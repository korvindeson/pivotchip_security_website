                    <h2>What is Penetration Testing?</h2>
                    <p>Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a simulated cyber attack against your systems to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. Our certified security professionals use the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers, but with proper authorization and ethical guidelines.</p>

                    <p>Unlike automated vulnerability scans, penetration testing involves manual exploitation attempts and creative attack scenarios that reflect real-world threats. This comprehensive approach helps you understand not just what vulnerabilities exist, but how they could be chained together to compromise your systems.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box info">
                        <h4>Why Penetration Testing Matters</h4>
                        <p>Cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated. Regular penetration testing helps you stay ahead of threats by proactively discovering weaknesses before malicious actors do. It's an essential component of a robust security program and often required for compliance.</p>
