                    <h2>What is Red Teaming?</h2>
                    <p>Red teaming is an adversarial security assessment that simulates real-world attack scenarios over extended periods. Unlike traditional penetration testing that focuses on finding vulnerabilities within a short timeframe, our red team engagements span weeks or months, employing sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that mirror actual threat actors.</p>

                    <p>Our red team operators combine offensive security expertise with custom hardware development capabilities. We design and deploy specialized devices tailored to your environment, creating realistic attack scenarios that test your organization's detection, response, and resilience capabilities under conditions that closely mirror genuine threats.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box info">
                        <h4>Beyond Traditional Penetration Testing</h4>
                        <p>Traditional penetration tests typically last a few days to a week and focus on vulnerability discovery. Red teaming provides extended engagements (2-8 weeks or longer) that simulate advanced persistent threats, test your security operations center's detection capabilities, and validate your incident response procedures under realistic conditions.</p>

                        <h3>Extended, Realistic Engagements</h3>
                        <p>Unlike traditional penetration tests limited to a few days or a week, our red team engagements run for extended periods that mirror real-world attack scenarios.</p>

                        <h4>Extended Engagement Structure:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>2-4 Week Engagements:</strong> Standard red team operations with multiple attack phases</li>
                            <li><strong>4-8 Week Engagements:</strong> Advanced persistent threat (APT) simulation with sophisticated TTPs</li>
                            <li><strong>3-6 Month Engagements:</strong> Long-term adversary simulation testing sustained detection and response</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous Red Teaming:</strong> Ongoing adversarial testing with periodic campaigns throughout the year</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Why Extended Engagements Matter:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Realistic Pacing:</strong> Attackers don't rush—extended timeframes allow for careful reconnaissance, lateral movement, and persistence</li>
                            <li><strong>SOC Testing:</strong> Evaluate your security operations center's ability to detect threats over time, not just immediate attacks</li>
                            <li><strong>Incident Response Validation:</strong> Test your team's response to detected intrusions in realistic conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistence Mechanisms:</strong> Evaluate ability to maintain access through system reboots, patching cycles, and security updates</li>
                            <li><strong>Evading Detection:</strong> Employ low-and-slow techniques that mirror actual threat actor behavior</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Phased Approach:</h4>
                        <p>Our extended engagements follow realistic attack progressions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Reconnaissance, social engineering, initial access attempts</li>
                            <li><strong>Week 2-4:</strong> Establish persistence, lateral movement, privilege escalation</li>
                            <li><strong>Week 4-6:</strong> Objective achievement (data exfiltration, domain compromise, etc.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Week 6+:</strong> Sustained access, detection evasion, advanced objectives</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Real-World Scenario Simulation:</h4>

                        <li>Confidential handling of all discovered vulnerabilities and accessed data</li>
                        <li>No retention of client data beyond demonstration of access</li>
